create an npm project:
    -intellij - open new project; static web page; name it.
    -github - create a new repo; name it; follow instructions.
    -make sure you have node and npm installed
    -in terminal:  npm init
    -load libraries
    -create a src dir and add index.js
    -create a public dir and add index.html with a script tag pointing to main.js
<!--        -<script src="main.js"></script>-->
    -update gitignore with:  public/main.js, *.map, node_modules
    -in terminal:  npm install
    - in the package.json file add the following to the scripts:
            "build": "webpack",
            "build:watch": "webpack -- watch"
            "build:production": "webpack -p"
    - in terminal:  npm run build






npm init - creates an npm project in the current directory
        - generates a package.json

npm install - installs dependencies libraries.
        in the terminal, you can install more than one library, just separate by spaces.
    Example:  npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-ev webpack webpack-cli

npm uninstall - uninstalls libraries

npm run SCRIPT-NAME - this puts all your files together and update changes throughout your project.
        - in your package json file, there are scripts.  these are the names that you can run
                            Example:
                            package.json - "scripts":{
                                                "build": "webpack"
                                            }
                            in terminal:
                                npm run build

npm update PKG-NAME - updates your library.  omit the package name to update all


npmjs.com is where you get libraries.
    look at the documentation.  it shows how to install and look for the variable name.  add let variable name = require ('xyz') to your index.js
        Example - install jquery and randomColor libraries
            const $ = require('jquery')
            const randomColor = require('randomColor')
                -- next, call your variable
           let color =  randomColor ();
            to use: $('body').css('background-color', color);


Libraries we used for class:
    @babel/core - how babel transpiles code
    babel-loader - allows webpack to use babel
    @babel/preset-env - how the code should be transpiled
    webpack - the module bundler
    webpack-cli - a required dependency to issue webpack commands

don't need iffes.
doc ready is not neccessary to project variables but good for the timely access to the document object
libraries for codeup - it makes no difference if they are in dependencies or dev dependencies list.
