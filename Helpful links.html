The Difference Between :nth-child and :nth-of-type | CSS-Tricks

Hope everyone is having a good Saturday!
Google has an open resource of their guidelines that determine the page quality rating of our (future) webpages we create :the_horns::skin-tone-3: it doesn't affect where your page shows up in a search, but looks like a great guide to building a top quality webpage.
